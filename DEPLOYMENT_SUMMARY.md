## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway

1. **Prepare Repository:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Railway:**
   - Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select the `backend/` directory as root
   - Railway will auto-detect Node.js and use our configurations

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key
   SCAM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

4. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Check health endpoint: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/health`
   - Should return: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","uptime":...}`

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Netlify

1. **Deploy on Netlify:**
   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Configure build settings:
     - Base directory: `frontend`
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `.next`

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app
   ```

3. **Update CORS (Important!):**
   - Copy your Netlify domain (e.g., `https://amazing-app-123.netlify.app`)
   - Update `backend/src/server.mjs` CORS origins:
     ```javascript
     origin: [
       'https://your-netlify-domain.netlify.app',
       'https://your-custom-domain.com'  // if you have one
     ]
     ```
   - Redeploy backend on Railway

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify these features work:

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Navigation menu works
- [ ] Lessons page displays all lessons
- [ ] Individual lesson pages load
- [ ] Simulator page shows all personas
- [ ] All styling and animations work

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds
- [ ] Scam chat API works (requires OpenAI key)
- [ ] Scam evaluation API works
- [ ] CORS allows frontend requests
- [ ] Error handling works properly

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Frontend can connect to backend
- [ ] Scam chat functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] Evaluation and scoring works
- [ ] No console errors in browser

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Security
- **Never commit real API keys** to Git
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Railway dashboard only
- CORS is configured to only allow your domains

### Performance
- Frontend is fully static (fast loading)
- Backend uses serverless functions (scales automatically)
- OpenAI API calls are rate-limited by OpenAI

### Costs
- **Netlify:** Free tier sufficient for this app
- **Railway:** $5/month after free credits
- **OpenAI API:** Pay-per-use based on chat volume

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build fails on Netlify:**
- Check base directory is set to `frontend`
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json

**Backend won't start on Railway:**
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check Railway logs for specific errors

**CORS errors:**
- Update backend CORS origins with your actual domains
- Redeploy backend after CORS changes

**API calls fail:**
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` points to Railway app
- Verify backend health endpoint is accessible

## 🎉 Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Test thoroughly** using the checklists above
2. **Set up monitoring** (Railway and Netlify provide basic analytics)
3. **Configure custom domains** (optional)
4. **Set up automated backups** for any user data
5. **Monitor OpenAI usage** and costs

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
- Check individual README files in `frontend/` and `backend/`
- Review Railway and Netlify logs
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
- Verify your OpenAI API key has sufficient credits
